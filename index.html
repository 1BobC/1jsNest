<h1>Nested functions from "https://javascript.info/closure"</h1>
<p>A function is called “nested” when it is created inside another function.</p>
<h3>1 - Exercise 1 - firstName, lastName</h3>
<p><div id="Ex 1a"></div></p>
<p><div id="Ex 1b"></div></p>

<h3>2 - Ex 1a, 1b copied by hand with changes</h3>
<p><div id="Ex 1x"></div></p>
<p><div id="Ex 1y"></div></p>

<h3>and Encapsulation</h3>

<h3>Example Closure</h3>

<h3>Example from JS learning outcomes2 file, outer, inner</h3>

<h3>Example similar (simple) as above, parent, child</h3>

<h3>Example again similar (simple) as above, bo, peep</h3>

<h3>Example do I remember (simple) as above? Hand in glove</h3>

<h3>Example do I remember (simple) as above? Do I still remember?</h3>

<h3>Redo example of Scope defining the visibility and accessibility of variables.</h3>
<p>The inner scope function (console.log(outerVar)), has accessessed the outer scope function 
   variable (let outerVar = 'I am from outer scope';)
</p>

<h3>Redo example of Encapsulation</h3>
<p>Variables and functions are kept private within the scope of their containing function. 
   This helps in avoiding naming conflicts and provides a clean structure. 
   NB - Check-out the coding of the three Counters 
</p>

<h3>Exercise Closure.</h3> 
<p>Allows inner functions to "remember" the environment in which they were created.
   This enables them to access variables from their containing functions even after the 
   outer function has finished executing.
